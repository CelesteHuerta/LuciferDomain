<p> <font color="white"><center> Name: Demonatron (Mr. Long Legs, official name given by Nebula Vylad) </center></font></p>
<p> <font color="white"><center> Experiment Number: TW0-S1X </center></font></p>
<p> <font color="white"><center> Class: Parasite </center></font></p>
<p> <font color="white"><center> Subject: Mr. Ichabod Inanis Daemonium </center></font></p>
<p> <font color="white"><center> Goal: Create a separate life and preserve a soul after it dies </center></font></p>
<p> <font color="white"><center> Behavior: </center></font></p>
<p> <font color="white"> -Mr. Long Legs appears to small children as imaginary friends and sworn to protect them from the many dangers that he was sworn to protect many, many millenniums prior.
 </font></p>
<p> <font color="white"> -Much like his living unicorn counterpart, he is constantly smiling and giggling. However, unlike his living counterpart, Mr. Long Legs never speaks.
 </font></p>
<p> <font color="white"> -Often confused with games that involve adults. Very violent in nightmares with the parents of children he defends.
 </font></p>

 <p> <font color="white"><center> Notes: </center></font></p>
<p> <font color="white"> -Mr. Long Legs does not engage with adults and often avoids them/attacks them in the unconscious state of mind. He has the power to give comas to ponies and even kill them on the spot, but because he is often around children and he dislikes contaminating their minds with things such as death, he doesn't kill anyone.
 </font></p>
<p> <font color="white"> -Typically, when a child grows out of the age of imaginary friends and such, Mr. Long Legs goes off to find a new child to protect, however, Mr. Long Legs had been put to rest for millenniums when Lucifer entrapped him in a crystal.
 </font></p>
<p> <font color="white"> -Mr. Long Legs cared for a total of 26 children. 20 of them were children in Prequestrian times. The last child he cared for before he was banished to his crystal, was Hope, herself. The first thing he did when he was released from his crystal was look for Hope, but with no avail, he did the next best thing and latch onto a troubled child: Brutalfly Lullaby Vleermuis who had made friends with another experiment of Lucifer: 3X-B6. Because of her exposure to Lucifer's past creations, she was neither startled or scared of Mr. Long Legs, and instead, welcomed him as a friend. He, once again, felt like he had a purpose.
 </font></p>
<p> <font color="white"> -Mr. Long Legs has a favorite child, and while for a long time, it was Hope Nomed, Lucifer's very own daughter, it has now converted to the modern era's child, Nebula Vylad-Vleermuis. Her determined nature and closed off Personality has drawn him to her, wondering if she desired a friend. He loved her so much that he stuck around even when she became an adult. Although she took medication and feared she had become schizophrenic, he stuck around and continued to protect her, even when she had children of her own.
 </font></p>
<p> <font color="white"> -Nebula died while giving birth to her third child, and while in the realm between Life and Death, Mr. Ichabod Inanis Daemonium had made his appearance to Nebula, introducing himself to her in all his glory as if they met for the first time, but Nebula knew that smile. She heard that laugh before. It was him, Mr. Long Legs. He had made a deal with her and promised her that she could return to both her children and husband under one condition. However, he never specified it with her, claiming it was a blind agreement, and sent her back once she agreed. Mr. Long Legs continues to watch over Nebula while Mr. Ichabod Inanis Daemonium waits between the realmsâ€¦ waiting to claim his bride.
