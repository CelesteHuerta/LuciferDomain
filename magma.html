<p> <font color="white"><center> Name: Magma Monsters </center></font></p>
<p> <font color="white"><center> Experiment Number: 1AV4 </center></font></p>
<p> <font color="white"><center> Class: Titan </center></font></p>
<p> <font color="white"><center> Subject: Lost Souls and Molten Lava </center></font></p>
<p> <font color="white"><center> Goal: Create a Titan that could protect the castle and Lucifer's wife </center></font></p>
<p> <font color="white"><center> Behavior: </center></font></p>
<p> <font color="white"> -Magma Monsters have no brain, no heart and no soul, but they can feel pain. In cool temperatures, they grow worrisome and try their best to contain warm. They create a protective layer or obsidian and igneous rock to keep the cold atmosphere out and keep their insides melted and in that lava state. Lucifer didn't understand how they could understand what cold was but nothing else. During the winter seasons, they go into a hibernation almost, only coming back out once the snow melted away. </font></p>
<p> <font color="white"> -They are essentially mindless slaves that don't control their own freedom and will, only doing what Lucifer commands them to do. </font></p>
<p> <font color="white"> -They are made of molten lava, so naturally they burn intensely when touched or even when in close proximity. They don't touch Lucifer, however, nor do they go in close contact with Vanth, his wife. Only those who oppose a threat to her or those who try to get close to Lucifer's castle and his experiments.  </font></p>

 <p> <font color="white"><center> Notes: </center></font></p>
<p> <font color="white"> -Their body temperatures reach to around 2,200 °C, but the outer layer and air around them is only around 660°C. They tend to constantly shed igneous rocks, only to reuse it and melt it back to lava. Nevertheless, they can instantly melt the flesh and skin off of any mustang's bones.  </font></p>
<p> <font color="white"> -When Lucifer tried to entrap the Magma Monsters in one of his regal chestplate's crystals, he was shocked to discover that it had exploded within close contact of the creature. Instead of forcing it into a gem, he entrapped it in LIMBO along with the Whisperer. They don't seem to interact with one another, but they are also not violent </font></p>
<p> <font color="white"> -Magma Monsters are typically one of the few experiments that weren't used for Shadow purposes </font></p>
 <p> <font color="white"> -Magma Monsters were immediately put to a stop when they caused a massive fire in Lucifer's castle. Fortunately, the king had convinced his brother, Universum that it had been an accidental torch fire that occured when a rusted bolt on a ceiling chandelier crashed down in a hallway, beginning the flames. Also fortunately, was that the fire hadn't touched his precious experiments and his beloved wife.  </font></p>
