<p> <font color="white"><center> Name: Reapers </center></font></p>
<p> <font color="white"><center> Experiment Number: 1347-BP </center></font></p>
<p> <font color="white"><center> Class: Supernatural Being </center></font></p>
<p> <font color="white"><center> Subject: Brains of dieners and body looters, plus smoke essence of Shadows. </center></font></p>
<p> <font color="white"><center> Goal: Creatures to protect the bodies of those who passed away and spirits who roam the endless plains of the Mortal Realm looking for anyone to help them crossover. Later Lucifer's goal had shifted, and he desired for them to be a collector of lost souls. </center></font></p>
<p> <font color="white"><center> Behavior: </center></font></p>
<p> <font color="white"> -Reapers are quiet, tame beasts that only roam the Mortal Realm at night. They know better than to mess with the Living world and can detect if a soul is still alive, or lost in time and reality, unknowing that they are dead.
 </font></p>
<p> <font color="white"> -They dislike sunlight and avoid it under all costs. If they are exposed to that, or any form of bright light, they shriek unholy cries of the Leviathan and wither into dust. Also when exposed to water during a Blood Moon, they can turn the liquid into pure plasma.  </font></p>
<p> <font color="white"> -They walk very slowly, as if the air around them is moving for them, like how the ocean waves can carry a jellyfish.  </font></p>

 <p> <font color="white"><center> Notes: </center></font></p>
 <p> <font color="white"> -When in close proximity, they are often shy creatures. When exposed to other fiends such as the Whisperer, Magma Monsters or Night Eaters, they prefer not to engage with them. They bring no harm to those creations and the other supernatural beings respectfully do the same, however, Reapers are very aggressive to Shadows and Lucious Mors Aeternaous.  </font></p>
 <p> <font color="white"> -It is possible for a normal citizen to see a Reaper, but those who do, often claim it was a beast from their dreams, or forget about the encounter entirely. Lucifer predicts that the Reapers have this amnesiac effect on those they encounter. Even his right hoofed stallion, Polished Mirror, sometimes forgets about any encounter he has had with them. Only Lucifer remembers clearly, but it's not as if he could forget his own creation.  </font></p>
 <p> <font color="white"> -They are almost anywhere. The shadow in the corner or your eye, the wind whispering in your ear, that sudden chill down your spine are all doings of Reapers. They are often bad omens and resemble death itself, but they truly don't hurt the living equines. Like their purpose states, they guide lost souls into the afterlife and bring some to Lucifer, only for them to be trapped in his mind games and forced into his further experiments.  </font></p>
 <p> <font color="white"> -Their body is shielded by a large cloak like substance, but they do hold a skeletal system and hold the brain tissue of ponies. However, their actual face is far more grotesque than what meets the eye, that is because Lucifer tears the flesh off of pre-existing skulls to save for other experiments. Bugs and rotting flesh can often be seen from under the cloak, underneath the smoke, and beyond the glowing eyes.  </font></p>
