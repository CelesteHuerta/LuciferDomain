<p> <font color="white"><center> Name: The Whisperer </center></font></p>
<p> <font color="white"><center> Experiment Number: B4-666 </center></font></p>
<p> <font color="white"><center> Class: Supernatural Being </center></font></p>
<p> <font color="white"><center> Subject: Shadow Essence  </center></font></p>
<p> <font color="white"><center> Goal: Collect as many Shadows as possible for further experiments </center></font></p>
<p> <font color="white"><center> Behavior: </center></font></p>
<p> <font color="white"> -The Whisperer can’t be seen in the Mortal Realm, or in simpler words, our reality: our world. The Whisperer was created and contained in LIMBO for the safety of Lucifer’s family and his brother discovering the creations in his castle. More information to be shared in ~Notes~. </font></p>
<p> <font color="white"> -In LIMBO, the Whisperer tends to roam around the dimension, traveling around it once every 40 Time Ticks (24 Earth Hours), as if it was guarding the domain.  </font></p>
<p> <font color="white"> -When introduced to an equine, the Whisperer doesn’t seem to acknowledge the presence of the mustang, however, on record, when a Shadow is [usually] forced into LIMBO, the Whisperer doesn’t hesitate to shred the smoke from its tail when it does it’s Timely wander and catches the Shadow.
 </font></p>
 <p> <font color="white"><center> Notes: </center></font></p>
<p> <font color="white"> -The Whisperer is made of at least 500 different “aged” Shadows from all strength levels.  </font></p>
<p> <font color="white"> -This experiment happened 300 Star Rotations before the birth of Princess Celestia Heavenlight and was rumored to last until Lucifer’s demise. Since then, no Shadows have been fed to the Whisperer, and whatever Shadows remained beyond the Experiments of the deranged baticorn and the wrath of Dorchadas fear what would happen if they wander in the being’s region. </font></p>
<p> <font color="white"> -When Mages, Sorcerers, and powerful Wizards try to unlock the gate between LIMBO and the Mortal Realm, they are often stuck at a field between the two realities. They say that before his death, Lucifer was the one who created the forcefield, and many speculate that it was meant to keep others from letting the Whisperer free. </font></p>
<p> <font color="white"> -The Whisperer grows in size the more Shadows it collects. It has large limbs and digits that resemble a smokey substance, and within the clearing of open smoke, one would see what appears to be fire, however, when touched, you feel the cold bite of frost. You can tell you are close to the beast when you begin to shiver from a sudden chill and you begin to see your frozen breath. </font></p>
<p> <font color="white"> -The Whisperer got its name from the many distorted and quick whispers that can be heard when in close contact with the beast. The majority of whispers, when documented by Lucifer, state to be closely resembling children whispers, but he has also recorded that he heard whispers of his parents after their ReMortal.  </font></p>
<p> <font color="white"> -When Lucifer’s right hoofed stallion (Polished Mirror) came to report the Whisperer’s behavior himself, he informed the tyrant king that he heard the whispers children as well, but he couldn’t hear the voices of Pulchriores Galaxium or Caelesti Lumine, but instead, his deceased family members.  </font></p>
<p> <font color="white"> -What the whispers say are usually jibberish or misunderstandable nonsense. Some words that have been heard most by Lucifer and his operators were: “Guilty”, “Legacy”, “Oblivion”, “Eternal”, and “Forgotten” </font></p>
