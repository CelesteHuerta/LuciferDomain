<p> <font color="white"><center> Name: Darklings </center></font></p>
<p> <font color="white"><center> Experiment Number: 53ARCH </center></font></p>
<p> <font color="white"><center> Class: Parasite </center></font></p>
<p> <font color="white"><center> Subject: Mr. Ichabod Inanis Daemonium </center></font></p>
<p> <font color="white"><center> Goal: Create a separate life and preserve a soul after it dies </center></font></p>
<p> <font color="white"><center> Behavior: </center></font></p>
<p> <font color="white"> -Darklings are very aggressive to outsiders. They are also aggressive to their own kind and to Changelings as well. They are also cannibals, for females eat males, and when they are desperate and starving for flesh, often eat their own children while they are in their larvae stage. Sometimes, a mother would sacrifice a limb to feed their children, or in rare cases, die entirely to feed their grubs.
 </font></p>
<p> <font color="white"> -Darklings reproduction is not at all similar to Changeling reproduction. While Changelings have one Queen who lays thousands of eggs that hatch into larvae and grow into drones, Darklings reproduction is very much like a normal equine reproductive routine, however, the father is sometimes killed only for the female to eat the corpse.
 </font></p>

 <p> <font color="white"><center> Notes: </center></font></p>
<p> <font color="white"> -Darklings are very closely related to Changelings and are only a few genes away DNA wise to an actual Changeling. However, Changelings rely on a Queen whereas Darklings do not
 </font></p>
<p> <font color="white"> -Darklings feast of happiness and life of ponies, whereas changelings feast on love. They can sense happiness within their scales and can feel waves of joy directed from one equine to the next. They have poor sight and smell, but have excellent hearing and they move at lightning speed, often catching their prey off guard.
 </font></p>
<p> <font color="white"> -Darkling infestation is a serious threat, and when a nest is built, oftentimes a town is under lockdown, praying that they die out or build their best elsewhere. They also migrate South for the cold, Winter seasons, which brings relief to the townsfolk.
 </font></p>
<p> <font color="white"> -Darkling drones are the first parasite created to hold different genders. Changeling drones are all non-binary and cannot reproduce, unless if an egg hatched was gifted the right requirements to become an Queen larvae  At first try, Lucifer attempted to make changeling drones have different genders, but an error had caused them to be non-binary.
 </font></p>
<p> <font color="white"> -Darklings are bigger than Changelings, and have a larger wingspan and wing beat. They also have a darker color palette in their abdomen that range from dark violet to blood red. Changelings are more muddy-yellow to sea green or dark cyan blue.  </font></p>
