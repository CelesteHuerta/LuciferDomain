<p> <font color="white"><center> Name: Night Eaters </center></font></p>
<p> <font color="white"><center> Experiment Number: 1050-20 </center></font></p>
<p> <font color="white"><center> Class: Supernatural Being </center></font></p>
<p> <font color="white"><center> Subject: Children of vast families in Prequestrian society. Ages range from 4-12. </center></font></p>
<p> <font color="white"><center> Goal: Can the youth be preserved for eternity? That is what Lucifer wishes to discover for his final experiment that he desires to uncover when his time is to come. Of course, immortality is not that arduous to introduce into a being’s existence, however, remaining a child forever- forever holding onto that childlike innocence and honesty- is what he fancies to do for the possible sake of his own daughter once he discovers how innocent his heir has been.
 </center></font></p>
<p> <font color="white"><center> Behavior: </center></font></p>
<p> <font color="white">  </font></p>
<p> <font color="white"> -The first dozen of children or so had been fatalities.  </font></p>
<p> <font color="white"> -The Night Eaters are only active when the Moon is engulfed by the dark matter of night (New Moons) and can enter the Spirit world as they please. </font></p>
<p> <font color="white"> -They are very quiet spirits and don’t talk to any living mortal. They hardly talk at all, really. Children wander the plains and search for their parents more than anything. They communicate via mind-reading. </font></p>
 <p> <font color="white"><center> Notes: </center></font></p>
<p> <font color="white"> -After the tenth day of each full moon, Lucifer collects 50 children and preforms these experiments on them. He did this for a total of 20 full moons. These children were the ones who have been made into the Night Eaters. </font></p>
<p> <font color="white"> -Their screams and cries for their parents and constant fidgeting has caused Lucifer to make many errors in his experiments and when studying their autonomy. Most who fidget had caused him to make wrong slashes, and they often bled to death. Because of this, Lucifer had made the choice to gouge out their eyes and stitch their mouths shut. For extra precaution, he also asked the children to drink a special concoction he created days prior to the experiment. The drink made children sick. For unicorns, their magic withers away completely in their horns. For pegasi, their feathers fall off and don’t regrow. For earth mustangs, their strength becomes worthless. Their bodies then become numb from the neck down, and although they can hardly feel any pain, the children continue to cry and muffle noises, begging for Lucifer to cease with no avail.  </font></p>
<p> <font color="white"> -If you are approached by a Night Eater, do not, under any circumstance, create a bond with them. Once you seal your relationship, whether it is parent and child or as simple as a friend-friend bond, they are locked into your mind and you will hear their non-stop laughter, screams, cries, and pleads from when they were alive. They tend to drive you insane. </font></p>
<p> <font color="white"> -If you desire to summon or witness one temporarily, there is a way to do it. First, you must return to the gravesite where all the casualties of lost children are held which is a closed off plot of land, guarded by Princess Celestia and Princess Luna. Hold a black candle to a gravestone at night and chant, “Lucifer won't hurt you” five times. Afterward, set a child’s toy, namely a ball or ragdoll by the unnamed slab and hope you aren't followed home. Once you completed the ritual you will see a child in your dreams and just a child. They will try to engage with you and get you to say to your name, but don't… that's how they get you to create that forbidden bond. After you wake up, you won't see the child anymore. They say that this is how they carry on their story and let others know that they are still here.  </font></p>
<p> <font color="white"> -Night Eaters were some of Lucifer's final experiments. He only studied children after his daughter, Hope Nomed, was born and quickly growing. </font></p>
<p> <font color="white"> -Night Eaters are also used to trick Shadows into choosing them as a host. If any were foolish enough, or desperate enough to use a Night Eater, the deceased child will begin tearing up the Shadow from the inside-out.  </font></p>
